A conversion from C to C++ of the "map" project. Has a couple more things: 

2012/01/29
- implemented classes instead of structs for game data
- each class has an update function called on idle loops (TODO: check if idle loop function is executed on movement frames)
- program ends when user walks up to the big red rectangle

Keys:
W,A,S,D - move forward, left, back, right
arrow keys - same as above
Q,E - rotate left, right
shift+W,shift+S - rotate up, down
+,- - speed up or slow down movement and rotation speed
F12 - Changes between QWERTY and DVORAK
